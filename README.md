# The Procrastination Habitation Application

A growing body of research suggests that humble mindfulness techniques can be extremely effective at helping [smokers quit](http://www.npr.org/2016/06/24/483123383/can-mindfulness-help-you-quit-smoking) and [treating depression](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/apr/21/could-mindfulness-therapy-be-an-alternative-to-antidepressants).

Can mindfulness help me control my procrastination habits? Will it decrease my unwanted internet binges and increase my grades? Will it do the same for *you*?

Within this repository lies the answer!

The **Procrastination Habitation Application** is a chrome extension that summarizes your browsing habits in a pleasant, easily-digestible format, with handy summary statistics and graphical visualizations. By providing insight into one's own habits, it aims to increase a user's mindfulness of these habits.

It doubles as a data collection mechanism for a research experiment. It logs your (*heavily anonymized*) activity to an external database. The extension doesn't collect any identity information from you, and it only logs the domain names of sites you visit.

By analyzing this anonymized data for many users, it can be determined whether the introduction of this chrome extension has a positive effect or not.
